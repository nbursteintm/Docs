# Customer Checklist



  
The development team requires the following key pieces of information from Product before beginning work on a new customer project. The list below is organized as follows: 

* Information required for both Android and iOS devices

* Release keystore: A keystore to sign production builds - if they will be signing it instead of giving us the key that's fine, but we need to know what the plan will be
