# Customer Checklist

The development team requires the following key pieces of information from Product before beginning work on a new customer project. The list below is organized as follows: 

* Information required for both Android and iOS devices
* Information required just for Android devices
* Information required just for iOS devices

## Information Required for Both Android and iOS Devices

* Production Company ID: a company ID for the new customer in the production environment
* Release keystore: A keystore to sign production builds, if necessary. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: If the customer will be signing production builds instead of giving us the key that's fine, but we need to know what the plan will be.
{% endhint %}
